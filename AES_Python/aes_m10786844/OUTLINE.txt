1) Read the message from  “../data/plaintext.txt and convert each char into ASCII(should be 128) and obtain the initial state
2) Read the two subkeys from “../data/subkey example.txt and calculate one AddKey before Round 1 with subkey0
3) Compute all the operations for Round 1 (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and one AddKey with subkey1) 
	-matrix for MixColumns can be found in Lecture 5, and how to perform
		the corresponding multiplication over bytes can be found in Lecture 10.
4)Screenshot the output and include it in the report

Read the first subkey from file “../data/subkey example.txt”, generate the next subkey using subkey schedule algorithm in AES. Print the next subkey in terminal and write the result to a file
“../data/result subkey.txt”. The result needs to be printed and written in hexadecimal.
