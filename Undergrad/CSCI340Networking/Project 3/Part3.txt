1)ICMP type - 8 (echo ping request
Code numbers - 0
This matches what I created in the program as I had specified all of this


2)ICMP type - 0 (echo ping reply
Code numbers - 0
This matches what I created in the program as I had specified all of this. There is no warning and everything is good to be checked


3) They target_addr is different when running it throught the program. I assume it is the name of a server while if you were to ping it like normal it would appear as just google.com
