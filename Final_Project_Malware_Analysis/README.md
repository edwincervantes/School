This guide explains how to run the tool, and provides examples of using the tool to disassemble Python.
- **Technical documentation**: This document is useful for anyone who wants to understand how
the disassembler works, or who wants to modify it for their own use.
- **Test cases:** Create a test suite with a large number of test cases to ensure that the disassembler
tool works properly and produces correct output.
